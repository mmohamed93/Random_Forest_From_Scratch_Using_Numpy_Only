# Random Forest Implementation

Implementing Decision Tree and Random Forest on Python From Scatch using Numpy only

this my version of Random Forest and Decision Tree that was implemented in fastai course. I have included more functionalities such as,
bootstraping, maximum features and a fair implementation of features importance.

In terms of results the tree yields the same results as Scikit-Learn Random Forest, but missing the parallel processing, so please try it
only on a small dataset. I will be happy if someone shares an implementaion of the parallel processing and better implentation of features importance.

I have also included the option of adding a sample size to work with (this option is not available in Scikit Learn ensembles)
